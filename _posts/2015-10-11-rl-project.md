<ul>
<li>We pose the problem of online learning of decision trees as Markov Decision Process.</li>
<li>This RL based approach provides a flexible framework which can incorporate Cost-Sensitive Learning and learns trees by examining far less attributes of data without making the myopic greedy assumption made by traditional learners.</li>
<li>Accepted at the 12th <a href="https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl12-2015/">European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning<a> held as a part of ICML 2015[<a href="https://ewrl.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ewrl12_2015_submission_26.pdf">pdf</a>].</li>
