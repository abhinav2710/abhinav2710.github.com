<h4> Abstract </h4>
<article>
Our goal is to understand the working of Convolutional Neural Networks. We are exploring ways to bootstrap the training process with hand crafted features to reduce demand for large training data.

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<article>
CNNs have become very popular for image classification. But there are essential problems with these classifiers. Most evident ones being the need for large data sets for training, large training times. The filters learned by grow in complexity as we go deeper. <br>
Can we bootstrap these networks with some handcrafted features to reduce the time it takes to train? <br>
CNNs are also fooled very easily, one can generate random images which are misclassified as objects. Can this sort of bootstrapping prevent such misclassifications by learning essential structures which are captured by these low-level features.
