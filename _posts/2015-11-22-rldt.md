<h4> Abstract </h4>
<article>
We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning-based method to learn online decision trees, that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to actively examine a minimal number of features of a data point to classify it with high accuracy. Furthermore, RLDT optimizes a long term return, providing a better alternative to the traditional myopic greedy approach to growing decision trees. We demonstrate that this approach performs as well as batch learning algorithms and other online decision tree learning algorithms, while making significantly fewer queries about the features of the data points.
