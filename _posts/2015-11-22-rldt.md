We pose the problem of learning decision trees as a Markov Decision Process. This allows us to learn the trees in a online fashion. We perform as well as the traditional learning methods while querying a lot fewer attributes, thus making it a good Cost-Sensitive Learner.
Accepted at the 12th <b>European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning</b> held as a part of ICML 2015.
