Hi! I'm Abhinav Garlapati, a Dual Degree student in the <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/"> Department of Computer Science </a> at the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>, India. I will be graduating next July with Masters and Bachelors degrees.
<br/>
<br/>
My academic interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am interested in application of learning techniques for tasks like recognition and detection of objects and activities from videos and images. I am very much intrigued by the success of Convolutional Neural Networks in vision and wish to explore them to understand how they work.
